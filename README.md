A world generator

Goals:
* Rework scaling to use all values 0.0-1.0 rather than just max = 1.0
* For the top and bottom, seed each element with an identical value (simple implementation compared to the alternative).
* Add a variable to control the smoothness of the map, so that I can also add a function to variably smooth some areas more than others.
